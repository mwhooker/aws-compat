run each path through test graph asynchronously


Add Assert methods to base test a la TestCase. ex:
    assertTrue
    assertCanGET # expect 200 back. May need to retry on S3.

Improve logging

not only test that, say, security groups work to allow connections, but check that they don't allow connections.

fix TestInstance.
    - canTelnet failing

write general purpose requester which polls until the response changes 
    that will let us remove util.wait & util.retry


write debug lib which drops into iPython shell every time an assertion triggers.
