run each path through test graph asynchronously


convenience method for accessing parent attributes
    search towards root for attribute
    self.parent('key')

allow multiple dependencies
    TestKeyPairs    TestSecurityGroups
        \ _               _ /
           \             /
            TestInstance
    TestInstance.key_pairs.key_pair
    (or TestInstance.parents[TestKeyPairs].key_pair)
    # pass explicit arguments to pre. let pre do saving.
    # or keep setup
    TestInstance.security_groups.group
    use topo sort


Add Assert methods to base test a la TestCase. ex:
    assertTrue
    assertRaises
    assertCanSSH(host, key) # uses retry w/ expo backoff
    assertCanGET # expect 200 back. May need to retry on S3.

Improve logging

not only test that, say, security groups work to allow connections, but check that they don't allow connections.

ditch setup/*_condition. merge into pre/post
