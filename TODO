run each path through test graph asynchronously

Add Assert methods to base test a la TestCase. ex:
    assertTrue
    assertCanGET # expect 200 back. May need to retry on S3.

Improve logging

not only test that, say, security groups work to allow connections, but check that they don't allow connections.

fix TestInstance.
    - canTelnet failing

write general purpose requester which polls until the response changes 
    that will let us remove util.wait & util.retry

write debug lib which drops into iPython shell every time an assertion triggers.

enpoints may fail because of internal server errors. Account for that and retry at a higher level (i.e. in the runner)

Potentially, for more explicivity: in the runner, pass the next method to the post method of the current test a la WSGI. Let the test decide when to call next
Cons are that the user may not call next.
